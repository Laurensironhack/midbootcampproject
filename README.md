# midbootcampproject

The mid-bootcamp project is done as part of the IronHack Data Analytics course.

I found the dataset on kaggle.com.
Acknowledgements:
The data was scraped from La Veranda Hotel on Booking.com. All data in the file is publicly available to everyone already. Please be noted that data is originally owned by Booking.com.

Data Context
This dataset contains 1,500 customer reviews for an hotel in Larnaca-Cyprus. The hotel opened exactly one year before the data was scraped, and these reviews provide valuable insight into the experiences of guests who stayed at the property during its first year of operation.

Applications used:
Jupyter (Python)
SQL
Tableau
Google Sheets

I visualised my analysis using the charts made in jupyter and Tableau. Google sheets was used to make the presentation.
After my presentation I found out that I made a significant mistake in my code, which I later fixed. Thus, the presentation is not a
100% good presentation of my findings.

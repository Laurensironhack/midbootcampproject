Perfect for our short stay and the hotel was immaculately clean.

"Nice, clean, priceworthy and with great staff!","Excellent staff in this family driven hotel. Very helpful and pleasant people who speak perfect English and couldn't have been better -- all the way from the booking process and online dialog to putting us on a taxi to the airport! This alone is reason enough to come back :-)
Rooms and hotel in general are very clean, aircon modern and quiet, and room service is also excellent.
Plenty of electricity outlets in the room, also by the bed, but remember the UK-adapter to use standard EU-plugs ;-)
The double bed, although nothing fancy, was probably the best hotel bed we've slept in ... ever!!!","Except excellent staff/owners and an ok restaurant, there is not much extra in this hotel or in the room. 
Tips for improvement:
- The out-of-order pool table hidden away in the backyard should be brought back to life.
- The backyard itself could actually have been used so much better. 
- The small fridge in the room was warm (turned off) upon arrival and completely empty, and no local shop/kiosk nearby to fill it up. One small bottle of water upon arrival to double room feels a little poor. Would gladly have paid those 2‚Ç¨ more per day to have 2 bottles initially and being refilled daily with room service. A couple of cents more, to have even tea on the small welcome tray ;-)
- Bathroom floor gets completely wet when (carefully) showering, as only half a glass wall covers the shower. 
- Bed frame has very sharp/hard corners, and it's easy to get hurt. Apply baby safety corners?
- Veranda door and main door doesn't close entirely tight so main door slams in the night when it's windy. However fixable in MacGyver way using the bed cover and a tea spoon, although a professional seal attached to the door frame would probably be a better fix long-term ;-)
- Beach towel services would also have been nice and useful, to avoid using lots of space/weight in baggage.
All in all, this hotel is great but still has room for improvement in many little details which could easily be fixed. Still getting our high rating as the staff is simply the best and made our stay a true pleasure, thus above comments should not scare anyone from booking this hotel.

Best hotel in cyprus,"If I could give more than a rating of 10 I would. 
The location is amazing. Being close to the airport in Larnaka makes travelling easier. Also being right next to the Salt Lake is a must-see especially if there is a good sunset. 
Within a 10 minute walk you can be on MacKenzie beach which is well maintained and cleaner than other beaches we seen in Larnaka. Rebuke lounge at the beach is worth visiting for the quality of food and decor. 
The hotel is next to a bus stop for travelling between downtown and other locations. Very handy since we didn‚Äôt hire a car. 
The staff make this hotel great. They are friendly, warm, helpful. Always willing to do more to make the guest have a better stay. 
The recently renovated room is about as clean as it could be. The facilities are modern and new. The shower is amazing for couples to use together. The balcony is a nice addition to an already fresh, well presented room. 
The double bed is extremely comfortable and the new bedding was a delight. It is hard to get a comfortable sheet to sleep with in a country as warm as Cyprus but we were happy with everything offered by the hotel. 
The minibar was extremely reasonably priced and well stocked. 
Aircon perfect, easy to use. 
Wifi great when we used it. 
We didn‚Äôt take advantage of the pool in the hotel only because we ran out of time but on another trip we would have done so.
